    <h4>The <strong>Hedgehog</strong> is about 20 centimeters long and is a large species.<br>
        Spines are raised on the body, and overall, they are strong and have dark patterns shaped like horizontal lines.<br>
        When faced with a natural enemy, the four legs are gathered on the belly and rounded like a ball to defend themselves with thorns on their backs.<br>
        The ears are short, the snout is pointed, and the toenails are well developed.<br>
        From November, she enters hibernation and thorns, gives birth to three to seven babies per stomach, and the pregnancy period is about one month.<br>
        Sometimes I have a lot of pets at home and sometimes I have symbiosis with cats.</h4>
