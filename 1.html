    <h4>The <strong>Red panda</strong> is a mammal with a body length of 45 to 65 cm and a tail length of 30 to 50 cm.<br>
    It is also called "Rat Surfander," and its English name is red panda.<br>
    It lives across Myanmar, Bhutan, Nepal and India, and there are four in Korea.<br>
    The Lesser Panda classification is classified as the Lesser Panda family, which is more like weasels or skunks than bears and animals.<br>
    Red Pandas eat bamboo leaves, which make it difficult for the digestive system to digest vegetables, so they should eat a lot of bamboo.<br>
    females and males are about the same size as their fur.<br>
    It has an average life span of about eight years, and it often dies without giving birth to babies because it hates raising them.</h4>
